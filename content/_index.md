> In this land a thousand li across, orioles warble among radiant tints of red and green;
In waterside villages and by hillside city walls, tavern signs flutter in breeze.
Of the four hundred and eighty temples built in the Southern Dynasties,
Many towers and terraces are now there, shrouded in mist and rain.
> 
> Du Mu-Spring of south of the Yangtze River, around AD830
